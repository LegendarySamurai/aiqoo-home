AIQ Home magazine.","articleBody":"##p/#It is often said that the kitchen is the center of the house, it is where we spend many of our waking hours, and where many of our childhood memories took place.
    There are many ways in which you can remodel your kitchen and costs may vary significantly between different types of remodeling - that’s why you should have your game plan already set, before starting.##h3/#Start with setting goals - what do you want out of your new kitchen##p/#Many people start out by buying an appliance they wanted, fixing a cabinet or changing the old fashioned kitchen tiles, and continuing from there to the next thing and then the next - all without having a vision or budget in mind.
    When you plan your remodeling beforehand you make sure that the appliances fit, that the colors you choose for the cabinets work well with the rest of the kitchen, and that the kitchen itself compliments the home’s overall interior design.
    When thinking about such a plan ask yourself - what is it you want out of your new kitchen? Is it more about the style and design, comfort or about getting more out of your cooking skills.##h3/#Set a budget##p/#After you've figured out why you are remodeling your kitchen and envisioned how it's going to look like, it's time to set your budget for the entire project.
    Remodeling costs may range from a 1000$ to hundreds of thousands of dollars. While the national average is above 22K$ according to HomeAdvisor, it is not uncommon, for upscale properties, to find kitchen remodeling projects as costly as 15% of the property's value, easily reaching the 100k$ and beyond.
    ##h3/#Work with professionals##p/#To control your costs it's always wise to plan your kitchen with the help of an interior designer. A professional designer knows how to choose items that can save you a lot of money and get the result you want. You can save as much as thousands of dollars on tiles, countertops, lighting, sinks and other materials that a designer can be creative about finding and matching. A designer can also recommend remodeling professionals and assess labor costs. ##h3/#Choose the right appliances##p/#Kitchen appliances are very important for the style and functionality of your kitchen. A brand new kitchen won’t look as good with old appliances. When you're budgeting the project make sure you take appliances into consideration. Top of the line brands like Bosch or KitchenAid can really elevate the way your kitchen looks but cost top dollar. Choosing your kitchen appliances in advance also allows you to better plan the kitchen’s layout and ensure you get the measurements correctly.##p/#So whether you want to raise the bar for your family dinners or replace an outdated design, keep in mind to plan ahead, set your budget and work with professionals - that will help you save money in the right places and, most importantly, make sure you will be satisfied with the final result.

Read more on AIQ Home magazine.","articleBody":"##p/#One of the rooms in your home that time does not do justice with - is your bathroom. Water stains, dampness, fungi and water damage to tiles or interior walls are just a few examples homeowners point to, when asked about their reason to renovate and renew their bathrooms. While others decide to update the old looking design and enjoy a stylish and new bathroom.##p/#Bathroom renovations can vary greatly in terms of overall costs and results. You can expect to pay anywhere between 5k$ to 50k$. Of course, the size of your bathroom will affect the price, but there are other important points you should take into consideration before getting started, if you want to save money and get the best out of a new bathroom.##p/#The floor plan will be your biggest decision going into this project - and is the key factor that will determine your overall cost. If you are happy about where the shower, toilets and the sinks are located, then you will find yourself on the less expensive and simpler path, as you only wish to upgrade materials and installments. If you wish, on the other hand, to expand the bathroom, add niches, change the location of plumbing fixtures, you can most likely expect to pay over 30k$.##h3/#Contractors - who should you hire and what to pay attention to##p/#Like with any other professional you contract it's very important to read reviews and interview the contractor personally. When you invite them into your home and show them your bathroom, don’t hesitate to ask design related questions. It’s recommended to use the contractor's experience and even allow them to get creative - it can lead to results that you couldn’t imagine beforehand and save you money as well.##p/#An important tip - almost all contractors mark-up faucets, tiles and, plumbing fixtures, cabinets other material. This shouldn't be a dealbreaker for you, as long as the markup is reasonable of course. The comfort of not having to search and match each one of those individually is not the only reason for this markup. When a contractor provides those materials, he is basically assuming responsibility over them - and if something fails during the installation process, or even after the work is done, he will have to replace it without billing you. The other and more affordable, yet risky option, is to bring all those materials on your own without any warranties. ##p/#So - you have decided to remodel your bathroom, you’ve set a budget, interviewed and chosen a contractor, decided on a design and beautiful new features, signed a contract and agreed on a time frame for completing the job. That’s all well, but don't forget this following step many ignore - inspection and warranties. It is especially important with new installments and plumbing, to make sure that they are tested, not only upon finishing the work but in the following days as well. Be aware of your contractor’s responsibility for that, according to your contract.
    ##p/#Now, all that’s left is to enjoy your new bathroom."}}]}]</script>
